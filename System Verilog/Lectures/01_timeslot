A time slot is divided into a set of ordered regions, as follows:
    01) Preponed
    02) Pre-Active
    03) Active
    04) Inactive
    05) Pre-NBA
    06) NBA
    07) Post-NBA
    08) Pre-Observed
    09) Observed
    10) Post-Observed
    11) Reactive
    12) Re-Inactive
    13) Pre-Re-NBA
    14) Re-NBA
    15) Post-Re-NBA
    16) Pre-Postponed
    17) Postponed
The purpose of dividing a time slot into these ordered regions is to provide predictable interactions between
the design and testbench code.
