= assignment with recursively expand
:= assignment with simple expand
?= (variable is not assigned) ? use this assignment : ignore this assignment
+= assignment with appending this value

= Vs :=
1. =: the value will be assigned with final value after whole makefile
            x = foo
            y = $(x) bar
            x = xyz

      => y = xyz bar (not foo bar)
2、:= the value will be assigned with the latest value when makefile is executed until here (not final value).
      Depend on the position of ":=" inside Makefile

            x := foo
            y := $(x) bar
            x := xyz
      => y = foo bar (not xyz bar)
